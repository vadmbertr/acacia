in order to run the jupyter notebook, I had to go through the steps described here
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42321784/jupyter-modulenotfounderror-no-module-named-matplotlib
I also had to install jupyter via brew using the command
arch -arm64 brew install jupyter
(same for jupyterlab, launched with jupyter-lab cmd)

MultiMAP runs with python3.7 now
